# Nano Technology Engineering Class Backup Website
A Website for Hosting and Sharing the LEARN Class Content Backups and Class Software for the Nano Technology Engineering Cohort of 2021-2026.

As of June of 2025, the Univeristy of Waterloo is reducing every Students One Drive Cloud Storage from 5 TB to 25 GB. This reduction makes it difficult to share the Class Backup files in an efficient manner. In this current day, the Class Backups are around 45 GB. To get around this, I have decided to Host and Share the files on a Server and serve them through a Website.

As of Dec 2025, the website has been remade as a Blazor / .NET / C# Website with better security 

As of Jan 2026, the website now uses a Postgres SQL Backend and allows complete visibility and download of all files. Even when hidden behind compressed .7z files.

# Access
Website can be accessed through any Browser and through any Device if wanted through the following link [Nano-Backup-Website](https://135.23.125.170:9000/).
This Website is currently being hosted on a dedicated Mini PC in Waterloo.
